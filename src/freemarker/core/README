This package exists here because generating classes from FTL.jj produces classes with this package. These classes depends on other classes in the same package.
FTL.jj is slightly modified - white spaces are not SKIPped, but are TOKENs.
ParseException.java and TokenMgrError.java are taken from FreeMarker sources, because they are modified by authors of FreeMarker. https://github.com/freemarker/freemarker/blob/v2.3.22/build.xml
Other files are generated by JavaCC version 3.2 just like in FreeMarker. https://github.com/freemarker/freemarker/blob/v2.3.22/ivy.xml
